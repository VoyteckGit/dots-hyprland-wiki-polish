## What to expect 

- **Qt apps over GTK** ones. The latter are still themed properly, but are not used by default.
- **Material Design 3** look and feel
- **Familiar keybinds** for those coming from Windows or GNOME. No weird vim keybinds!
- **Opinionatedness**: This goes without saying for dotfiles
